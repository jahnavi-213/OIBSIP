			most popular Indian actresses from the 1950s to early 70s, and is known by the epithets Mahanati 
			and Nadigaiyar Thilagam. She is one of the most accomplished, most versatile and she is one of the
			 most respected actresses in South Indian Film Industry. She is known for her liveliness and her 
			 captivating performance and is still considered as the benchmark for acting in South Indian films.

			Nissankara Savitri was born on 6 December 1935 in a Telugu-speaking Kapu family
			 in Chirravuru, Guntur district of present-day Andhra Pradesh. Savitri, born to : 
			 Nissankara Subhadramma, Guravayya. Her father died when she was six months old, 
			 after which her mother took Savitri and an older sibling : Maruti, to live with 
			 an aunt and uncle. Her uncle, Kommareddy Venkata Ramayya Chowdary, enrolled her in 
			 classes when she began to show a talent for dance. She was named for the expression of her eyes during dramas.
		</p>
		<p>
			Savitri acted in dance dramas as a child, including some work with a theatre company run by 
			Jaggayya. She made an unsuccessful speculative trip to find film work in Madras at the age of 
			14 when she was deemed to be too young to play heroine roles, but in 1950 was cast as the female 
			lead in Samsaram. That role did not become actuality because she became too excited, necessitating 
			numerous retakes and eventually her replacement in the part. She was given a minor speaking role in 
			the film and in the next year had two more minor roles, in Roopavati and Patala Bhairavi, before getting 
			her big break as the second heroine in Pelli Chesi Choodu. She, later on, was propelled to stardom with 
			critically acclaimed roles in blockbusters such as Devadasu and Missamma. savitri acted in many more movies. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Her performance in the 1957 film Mayabazar skyrocketed her to stardom.She later went on to become the highest-paid 
			and most sought-after South-Indian actress of her generation. Savitri was known for her hospitality, 
			philanthropic gestures, and love of buying property and jewelry, but she kept little control of her spending. 
			Ganesan continued to philander and she was susceptible to favoring hangers-on with her largesse. In 1960, she 
			received the Rashtrapati Award which later became "National Award for the Best Actress" for her performance in the 
			Telugu film Chivaraku Migiledi. In 1968, she produced and directed the Telugu film Chinnari Papalu, for which she received 
			the state Nandi Award for Best Feature Film(Silver). Her career took a downturn in the late 1960s. Her properties were seized by 
			tax officials in the 1970s and she turned to act in any film in her later years, while sycophants encouraged her to direct and 
			produce films that were unsuccessful and financially draining. Among her few supporters during her financial troubles were 
			Dasari Narayana Rao, who cast her in most of his films, such as Gorintaku (1979), and specifically made Devadasu Malli Puttadu (1978) as a movie for her.

		<p>
			Director PC Reddy who directed Savitri says, “<b>there is none who can equal her beauty and talent. 
				She didn’t heed anyone’s advice and got married very early. I remember she was so addicted to 
				drinking even on the sets; she threw up on my shirt during a shoot. The next day she got a brand 
				new shirt for me. She was a generous woman</b>.”

			Sivaji Ganesan and her husband, Gemini Ganesan, mostly with the latter. Her notable Tamil works include 
			Kalathur Kannamma (1959), Pasamalar (1961), Pava Mannippu (1961), Paarthal Pasi Theerum (1962), Karpagam
